# Bestcrow backend

The backend has two sectors for the Charity Vault Solana program:

- `chain`: campaign reads, metadata, indexing and unsigned instruction builders.
- `accounts`: registration, sessions, verified Phantom links and SOL payment records.

Phantom keeps its keys and signs in the browser. The backend verifies ownership
and settlement using public addresses, signatures and chain data.

The chain sector provides:

- **Indexer** — polls the program's campaign and donor-ledger accounts, parses
  Anchor events from transaction logs, and stores everything in SQLite.
- **REST API** — fast campaign/donor/event listings, aggregate stats, and a
  filterable campaign search.
- **Off-chain metadata** — titles, long descriptions, images, and rewards, with
  the description verified against the on-chain `desc_hash` commitment.
- **Instruction builders** — stateless endpoints that return the accounts and
  hex instruction data any client needs to build a transaction (no signing).

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 22.5 (uses the built-in `node:sqlite` module)
- A Solana RPC endpoint (devnet by default)

## Setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env      # optional; defaults target devnet
npm run dev               # watch mode
```

Production:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

Validate:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm test
```

```

Sector modules separate service classes, DTOs, routes and exports. Constructors
receive their dependencies. The client follows TSOS's
`BaseClient -> RequestExecutor -> service` structure, using Bearer sessions.
Legacy route/helper exports delegate to these classes.

Tests compile to `dist-test/` and run recursively. HTTP tests execute real Node
HTTP parsing and Express routes over memory streams, without opening a port.
Wallet tests use temporary generated keys; payment tests inject RPC responses.

## Network and signing

`CLUSTER`, `SOLANA_RPC_URL` and `CHARITY_VAULT_PROGRAM_ID` identify the backend's
network. The frontend must use the same RPC and program. `/api/chain/config`
exposes that public configuration. A sector override that conflicts with runtime
settings is rejected.

Use Devnet for Phantom and fund the connected Phantom address there. Funding the
CLI deployer does not fund the user's wallet. Localnet returns `walletChain: null`
because it needs a wallet that explicitly supports that local network. Restart or
rebuild the frontend after changing its `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` settings.

No account endpoint reads a keypair file. Deployment and demo scripts remain CLI
tools with their own deployer. The Solana program checks the actual signer and
controls funds; account sessions protect off-chain resources.

## Client example

```ts
import { BestcrowClient } from './src/client/index.js';

const api = new BestcrowClient({ baseUrl: 'http://localhost:4000' });
const session = await api.accounts.login({ email, password });
const accountApi = api.withSession(session.token);
const challenge = await accountApi.accounts.createWalletChallenge({
  address: phantomAddress,
  purpose: 'link',
});
// Sign the exact UTF-8 message in Phantom and base64-encode its 64-byte signature.
await accountApi.accounts.linkWallet({ challengeId: challenge.id, signatureBase64 });

const payment = await accountApi.accounts.createPayment({
  campaign: campaignAddress,
  wallet: phantomAddress,
  amount: '100000000',
});
// Simulate and submit one Phantom-signed transaction with instruction + memoInstruction.
await accountApi.accounts.confirmPayment(payment.id, transactionSignature);
```

The fetch implementation and timeout are injectable. `withSession` creates a
separate client; it does not write the token into browser storage.

## Notes and limits

- The chain API retains the six existing base instruction builders. Rust staged
  funding and milestone instructions do not yet have backend builders.
- Account endpoints and SDK are implemented. Frontend account forms and payment
  intent integration must call the new SDK; the existing direct Solana path remains.
- Payments mean SOL pledges to campaigns. Email delivery, password reset and card
  processing are not implemented.
- Off-chain metadata is only as trustworthy as the hash check: a `verified: true`
  record means the stored description matches the on-chain SHA-256 commitment.
- The program caps a campaign at 12 donors, so `refund_all` fits in one legacy
  transaction.
- Event reconstruction depends on RPC log retention (`SIGNATURE_SCAN_LIMIT`);
  account state is always re-synced in full each poll.
