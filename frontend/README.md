# Bestcrow frontend

The frontend now contains the responsive Bestcrow discovery, campaign detail,
creation, explanation and “My support” views. Wallet transaction builders and
the final V2 API remain gated on the verified V2 deployment; the UI labels
those states instead of presenting legacy actions as final MVP behavior.
Follow the [ordered implementation plan](../docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)
for the financial rules and backend dependencies.

For the visual layer, use [Colosseum](https://colosseum.com/) as the design
inspiration. The [frontend sketch](STOCKGATE_FRONTEND_SKETCH.md#visual-reference)
explains how to adapt that reference to Bestcrow without copying its branding
or weakening the clarity of campaign and transaction states.

Reusable Solana helpers remain in `app/lib/` for the next implementation pass.
They retry transient Solana HTTP 429 responses and show a dedicated-provider
hint after the retry budget is exhausted.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## MVP screens and interaction requirements (planned)

1. A wallet-first session creates or resumes a backer account after a signed
   challenge, with no email required. A creator can add organization details
   for display. Do not show a verification badge or require platform approval
   to create an on-chain campaign.
2. The creation form collects and validates the entire campaign before the
   first transaction: startup description and durable metadata, goal, 7-day to
   six-month fundraising window, and 2-5 milestone allocations each at most
   50% and totaling exactly 100%. Show the no creator deposit, network
   costs, and the 1% success-only platform fee separately. Freeze campaign
   terms when fundraising starts; there is no post-start editing or adding
   milestones. The deposit's exact return conditions/timing remain to be
   specified and must not be implied in the UI until enforced on-chain.
3. Discovery and detail views show startup campaigns, allow the raised amount
   and progress to exceed the goal, and fetch metadata from durable storage.
   Check the on-chain description/proof hashes before displaying content as
   verified. Never treat a shareable URL parameter as trusted campaign copy.
4. Detail views show the actual on-chain lifecycle, proof links, claim status,
   fee and net milestone budget. Voting starts with a fixed seven-day window;
   approval requires yes weight strictly greater than 50% of all eligible
   pledged weight. Display that denominator, not just votes cast. No votes
   means rejection. Rejection opens a full 30-day revision window, then a
   seven-day second ballot. Surface permissionless finalize/timeout actions.
5. Pledging, cancellation during fundraising, individual full refunds after a
   failed goal, and approved milestone withdrawals must build the correct
   transactions. A failed goal takes no platform fee; refunds require a user
   transaction and are not automatic. Splits, already approved claims, and
   one-time milestone payment must match program accounting.
6. "My contributions" reconciles linked wallets with indexed on-chain stakes
   and claims, including direct wallet payments that never used a backend
   payment intent. Show eligibility, transaction status, and indexer freshness.

Reward entitlement and delivery are later server-side work. The UI must not
promise a reward fulfilment system before it exists. The frontend, backend,
program, and devnet deployment must use the same current program ID and rules.
